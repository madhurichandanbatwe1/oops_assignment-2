    "1. What is polymorphism in Python? Explain how it is related to object-oriented programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism in Python is the ability of different objects to be treated as instances of the same class through a common interface. It allows methods to have the same name but act differently based on the object calling them. This concept is crucial in object-oriented programming (OOP) as it promotes code reusability and flexibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relation to OOP:\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance: Polymorphism is closely related to inheritance. When a class inherits from another class, it can override methods of the parent class, providing different implementations.\n",
    "Encapsulation: Polymorphism works alongside encapsulation by hiding the internal workings of objects and providing a unified interface."

    "2. Describe the difference between compile-time polymorphism and runtime polymorphism in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is primarily a dynamically typed language, which means it mostly uses runtime polymorphism. However, understanding the concepts of compile-time and runtime polymorphism helps in grasping the broader picture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compile-time Polymorphism: Also known as static polymorphism, it occurs when method overloading or operator overloading is resolved at compile time. Python does not support method overloading (defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters) in the traditional sense, but it supports operator overloading.\n",
    "\n",
    "Runtime Polymorphism: This occurs when the method that gets executed is determined at runtime. Python achieves this through method overriding in inheritance. For instance, a method defined in a base class can be overridden in a derived class, and the method to be invoked is determined at runtime based on the object type."
