    "Method Name:\n",

    "Automatic Invocation:\n",
    "\n",
    "The constructor is automatically called when a new instance of the class is created. You do not call it explicitly.\n",
    "Parameters:\n",
    "\n",

    "Purpose of __del__ Method\n",
    "Resource Cleanup:\n",
    "\n",
    "The __del__ method is intended to release resources that the object may have acquired during its lifetime. This includes tasks like closing files, releasing network connections, or deallocating other system resources.\n",
    "Automatic Invocation:\n",
    "\n",
    "The __del__ method is called automatically when an object's reference count drops to zero, meaning there are no more references to the object. This is generally handled by Pythonâ€™s garbage collector.\n",
    "Finalization:\n",
    "\n",
    "It provides a way to perform finalization tasks. However, because Pythonâ€™s garbage collection is non-deterministic (i.e., you cannot predict exactly when it will occur), relying on __del__ for critical cleanup tasks is not always reliable.\n",
    "Relation to Constructors\n",
    "Initialization vs. Cleanup:\n",
    "\n",
    "The constructor (__init__) is responsible for initializing an objectâ€™s state when it is created. In contrast, the destructor (__del__) handles cleanup when the object is destroyed. They are complementary methods: __init__ sets up the object, and __del__ cleans up resources.\n",
