    "Composition is a design principle in object-oriented programming where a class is composed of one or more objects from other classes, rather than inheriting from a parent class. It represents a \"has-a\" relationship, where one class contains or is built using instances of other classes. This allows complex objects to be constructed from simpler, more manageable components, promoting modularity and reusability."

    "\n",
    "Inheritance: A class inherits attributes and methods from a parent class. It represents an \"is-a\" relationship. For example, a Dog class might inherit from an Animal class because a dog \"is an\" animal.\n",

    "\n",
    "Flexibility: Composition offers more flexibility as you can change the composed objects at runtime or replace them with other objects. Inheritance is more rigid.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reusability: Composition allows for better reuse of code and modularity since components can be used across different classes without altering their definitions.\n",

    "Coupling: Composition tends to reduce coupling compared to inheritance, as classes are less dependent on a fixed hierarchy."
