    "Inheritance in Python is a fundamental feature of object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows one class (called the child or subclass) to inherit methods and properties from another class (called the parent or superclass). Hereâ€™s a breakdown of its significance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Code Reusability: Inheritance promotes code reuse by allowing a subclass to use methods and attributes defined in its superclass(es). This avoids redundancy and promotes cleaner, more maintainable code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hierarchy and Organization: Classes can be organized into hierarchical structures where subclasses specialize behavior while inheriting common functionality from their superclasses. This helps in organizing and structuring complex systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Extensibility: Subclasses can extend the behavior of their superclasses by adding new methods or overriding existing methods. This flexibility allows for customization while maintaining compatibility with the superclass interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: Inheritance facilitates polymorphism, where objects of different classes can be treated as objects of a common superclass. This allows for more generic and flexible programming patterns.\n",
